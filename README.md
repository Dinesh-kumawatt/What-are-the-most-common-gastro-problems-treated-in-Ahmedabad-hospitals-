Digestive issues have become super common these days, especially in cities like Ahmedabad where lifestyle is fast and food choices are often not that great. From oily street food to late-night dinners and long sitting hours, a lot of these habits affect the digestive system without us even realizing it.

Some of the most common gastrointestinal (GI) problems people go to hospitals for include:

Acidity & acid reflux (also called GERD): This is probably the most frequent issue. You feel burning in your chest or throat, especially after eating spicy food or lying down right after meals.

Gas and bloating: Often people feel full, gassy, or tight in their stomach even without eating much. This could be due to food intolerance or digestion issues.

Constipation or loose motions: Both are extremely common. Stress, dehydration, or poor fiber intake can cause constipation. On the other side, food poisoning or infection can cause loose motions.

Liver problems like fatty liver or hepatitis: These are rising due to poor diet, alcohol use, or even certain viral infections.

Gallstones: Gallbladder issues cause pain in the upper right abdomen, especially after fatty meals. Many times surgery is needed.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): This is a mix of symptoms like cramping, bloating, and irregular motions, often triggered by stress or certain foods.

Ulcers: These are sores inside your stomach or intestine that can cause burning pain, especially on an empty stomach.

Pancreatitis: This is more serious and needs hospitalization. Itâ€™s inflammation of the pancreas, often caused by alcohol or gallstones.

Now the good thing is, many of these issues can be diagnosed early and treated easily with the help of a gastroenterologist. Tests like ultrasound, endoscopy, or blood work help doctors find out the root cause. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important not to ignore symptoms like frequent stomach pain, irregular motions, or unexplained tiredness.
